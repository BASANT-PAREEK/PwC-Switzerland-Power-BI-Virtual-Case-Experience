# PWC Bower BI Virtual Experience Project

## üìù Description

This project focuses on using Power BI to create dashboards and visualizations for different tasks related to telecom marketing and customer retention. The project consists of four tasks, each with its own background and objectives.

### Task 2: Call Centre Trends - Visualizing Customer and Agent Behavior

The objective of this task is to create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to customer and agent behavior in the telecom industry. The dashboard should provide insights into call center trends, helping the client understand customer preferences and improve service.

### Task 3: Customer Retention - Customer Demographics and Insights

In this task, the goal is to define proper KPIs for customer retention and create a dashboard specifically for the retention manager. The dashboard should reflect the identified KPIs and provide insights into customer demographics and behaviors. Additionally, a short email needs to be written to the engagement partner, explaining the findings and suggesting necessary changes to improve customer retention strategies.

### Task 4: Diversity & Inclusion - Gender Balance in the Executive Suite

The objective of this task is to define relevant KPIs related to gender balance in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover within the telecom company's executive suite. The task involves creating visualizations in Power BI to analyze and present the data. Additionally, an analysis of the root causes of the slow progress in achieving gender balance needs to be provided.
